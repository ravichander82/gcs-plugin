## Plugin with GCS backend
This plugin fecthces from GCS bucket and reads a Yml/JSON file for loading GCE account dynamically. Accounts are added and/or removed without restarting clouddriver service.


### Introduction
1. Clouddriver poller syncs  with a configured GCS bucket to update Spinnaker GCE accounts. Supports account addition, removal, and update.
2. Dynamic accounts loading - The plugin will perform a sync operation with configured GCS bucket to fetch accounts details from a file at runtime.


### Requirements
1. Must be used with Spinnaker version 1.24 (TODO) or higher.
2. Clouddriver must have support for Dynamic Accounts Loading [GCE support](https://github.com/kirangodishala/clouddriver/tree/1.26.x-external-accounts-support)
3. Must have a GCS bucket with bucketName, fileName to access the Yml/JSON file to load GCE accounts.


### Fetches and Loads GCE Account from a file in a Gcs bucket
This plugin fetches GCE accounts from a Yml/JSON file stored in a Gcs bucket.


```yaml
google:
   enabled: true
   accounts:
      - name: gcs-gcs-account
        requiredGroupMembership: []
        permissions: {}
        project: main-host-project-162535
        jsonPath: encryptedFile:gcs!b:gce-accounts-v1!f:gce-account.json
        alphaListed: false
        imageProjects: []
        consul:
           enabled: false
           agentEndpoint: localhost
           agentPort: 8500
           datacenters: []
   primaryAccount: gce-gcs-account
   bakeryDefaults:
      templateFile: gce.json
      baseImages: []
      zone: us-central1-f
      network: default
      useInternalIp: false
```


### Note
1. Plugin clones a Gcs bucket using the ADC , provided in plugin configuration and fetches a filename (Yml/JSON). 
   Expectation is that the bucket will return accounts that were updated after the specified time by the field.
   This is done to avoid returning and processing all accounts every time sync occurs.
   Attribute jsonPath of Google Account is stored as an encrtyped secret file. [profile](https://spinnaker.io/docs/reference/halyard/secrets/gcs-secrets/)
   E.g. ```jsonPath: encryptedFile:gcs!b:gce-accounts-v1!f:gce-account.json```
2. Google Account are added/removed dynamically without restarting any services.
